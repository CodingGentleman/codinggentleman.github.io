			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">04.2018 - present</span><span class="occupation">KNAPP Systemintegration GmbH<br/>Product Development</span></h3>
					<p>With the experience I gained in the project development team, I switched to the product development team for our warehouse management system. In a small team we continue to implement new features, enhance the core concepts and develop new tooling that will aid the project development teams. <br/>
					I studied part time while being part of the product development team and one of my thesis topics was to introduce a type-safe alternative to JPQL.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">02.2015 - 04.2018</span><span class="occupation">KNAPP Systemintegration GmbH<br/>Project Development</span></h3>
					<p>In my 3 years in the project development department, I was a part of different teams developing customer specific adaptions of our WMS (warehouse management system). Our WMS is a JEE application running within a Wildfly. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">09.2010 - 01.2015</span><span class="occupation">ACL advanced commerce labs GmbH<br/>Software Development</span></h3>
					<p>At JCL eCommerce GmbH I gained my first experience as a professional developer. As part of a small team, we developed a backend eCommerce solution stack for our customers. Major parts of the stack included a Java webservice running within a Tomcat, connected to DB2 and MySQL databases, with a servlet based frontend for our inhouse customer service. Additionally, developing asynchronous jobs managed with Automic were part of my daily work.</p>

			<h2>Education</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3><span class="timeframe">10.2017 - 02.2021</span><span class="occupation">FH Joanneum<br/>Software Design</span></h3>
					<p>After 8 years away from a formal education I decided it was time to pursue a new goal. I chose Software Design for two reasons. Firstly, the curriculum seemed interesting as software designs and architectures are topics I want to further develop my skills in and secondly, it was part-time. <br/>
					I didn't want to shift my main focus on academics, I wanted to add an academic background to my skills. However, in the second year, I reduced my working hours to 34 hours per week in order to be better prepared for the Friday and Saturday lectures. Of course, being in the industry for quite a few years, some subjects were easier for me but the time the projects consumed was still noteworthy.<br/>
					I wrote my first bachelor's thesis about the applied usage of the Criteria API, a type-safe alternative to JPQL. Feel free to check out <a href="https://familieschmid.at/t1" print="familieschmid.at/t1">my thesis</a> and the associated <a href="https://familieschmid.at/c1" print="familieschmid.at/c1">code</a>. For my second bachelor's thesis I chose the topic machine learning. I created a prototype that uses reinforcement learning to solve a variant of the bin packing problem. Again, feel free to read through <a href="https://familieschmid.at/t2" print="familieschmid.at/t2">my second thesis</a> or take a look at my <a href="https://familieschmid.at/c2" print="familieschmid.at/c2">prototype</a>.

					<h3><span class="timeframe">09.2004 - 05.2009</span><span class="occupation">HTBLA Kaindorf a. d. Sulm<br/>EDV und Organisation</span></h3>
					<p>I have fond memories of my time in the higher technical college. It sparked my joy for programming and I fell in love with Java. Not so much with JSF but thankfully that framework didn't take off. The foundation I got from attending this school was the perfect start for my technical carrer.</p>
